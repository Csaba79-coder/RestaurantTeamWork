= Restaurant

=== We have a restaurant to run.

Create a program which helps our employees handle our restaurant.
We have customers to serve!
Our customers will have their seat at our tables and request from our menu.
We need a software to handle our resources so we will know if we can serve our customers.

---

At the first step we does not need to worry about reloading our storages or washing our tools!

---

Our storage can be found in the .txt files in the resources folder (feel free to change it),
we need to upload the program from there.

Our incoming customers can be handled optionally from a file or using the Scanner with the Terminal.
f.e.: in the file each line will be a table/customer
Each table needs to handle customer requests.

You will find more hints in the already created classes,
but it is not mandatory to follow the given structure.
Feel free to create new classes and packages.
